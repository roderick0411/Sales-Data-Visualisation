# Visualizations in Python on Sales Data
The objective of this dashboard is to understand sales trends for one of the leading pharmaceutical company.
The client would like to come see a dynamic dashboard with different KPI's at different levels (National, Region & Territory etc). Create the below charts as these would help us explore the past data in a better manner and give a good picture of the progress and failures. This in turn would catalyse the decision-making process, making it easier, simpler and accurate.

## Task
1. Compare Sales by region for 2016 with 2015 using bar chart
2. What are the contributing factors to the sales for each region in 2016. Visualize it using a Pie Chart.
3. Compare the total sales of 2015 and 2016 with respect to Region and Tiers
4. In East region, which state registered a decline in 2016 as compared to 2015?
5. In all the High tier, which Division saw a decline in number of units sold in 2016 compared to 2015?
6. Create a new column Qtr using numpy.where() or any suitable utility in the imported dataset. The Quarters are based on months and defined as -<br/>
• Jan - Mar : Q1<br/>
• Apr - Jun : Q2<br/>
• Jul - Sep : Q3<br/>
• Oct - Dec : Q4<br/>
7. Compare Qtr wise sales in 2015 and 2016 in a bar plot
8. Determine the composition of Qtr wise sales in and 2016 with regards to all the Tiers in a pie chart.
